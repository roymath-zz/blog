<dt><strong>Abstract</strong></dt>
<dd> You can convert html documents directly into .mobi format files and
read them on your kindle. The article below shows how a linux user
might do so.</dd>

<dt><em>Motivation</em></dt>
<dd>I love to read on the Kindle The display is much easier on your eyes
Newer Kindles have backlighting and make it possible to read at night
without turning on a lamp, though I haven&#8217;t tried this. Compared to
glossy screen tablets with poor contrast, the readability of a kindle
improves when you go outdoors; text looks great (i.e no squinting).</dd>

<dt><strong>HTML -&gt; Kindle format</strong></dt>
<dd> I read a lot of technical documentation. Most of what I read is
available in HTML format and sometimes only in PDF form. Yes, you can
read PDFs on your Kindle - however the font tends to be kind of small
and it&#8217;s not my favorite way of reading. I wanted a better way and was
excited when I realize that you can convert files from HTML form to
.mobi, which is the format that the Kindle uses to display books.</dd>

<dt><em>.Mobi makes the font resizeable</em></dt>
<dd> Like HTML, .mobi files are semantic in nature, and your kindle can
resize the page to fit the width of the device. You can make the phone
quite large which is great for eyes that get tired easily, like mine.<p/>
The nice thing about HTML is that a lot of the semantics of the Page,
by which I mean bold text, headings, etc are recognizable by the
conversion program, and so your Mobi file tends to look quite nice.
when the conversion takes place.</dd>

<dt><em>Cons</em></dt>
<dd> The display is kind of small, especially with the Kindle Touch I
recently bought an oasis for the slightly larger (7 inch) display. My
conclusion is that screen size doesn&#8217;t matter as much as one assumes -
I think our craving for larger displays stems at least partly, from
the fact that we stare at big monitors all day and are used to seeing
the entirety of our pages when browsing.</dd>

<dt><em>Alternatives</em></dt>
<dd> There are other options than the Kindle, that offer bigger displays;
however they are quite expensive. Your average kindle touch sells for
about USD 100, and the oasis is closer to about USD 200. The closest I
could find in a large display that could comfortably display a
Letter/A4 size page (e.g. PDF document) in full size was about $600.</dd>

<dt><em>The kindle&#8217;s keyhole view</em></dt>
<dd> Most novels are meant to be read sequentially. As you&#8217;re reading, you
tend to develop a keyhole view. Once you get used to this, the
kindle&#8217;s limited display seems to fit that mode quite well, and offers
a distraction free reading experience.</dd>
